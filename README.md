# Minigrep

A smol me own version of the grep command line utility written in rust.
Made following Ch12 of the rust book. 

## Usage

```
Usage: minigrep <pattern> <file_path>
```
Can be run using `cargo run` or `cargo build` and then using the binary.

Set the `IGNORE_CASE` env variable to config minigrep to grep case independently.
